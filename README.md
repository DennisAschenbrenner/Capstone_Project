# Capstone_Project

This project is about evaluating regression and classification models of machine learning on weather data. 
Additionaly I used ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM.
Machine Learning is came up in the last few years in numerical weather prediction to produce more accurate predictions. 
Some weather models use stepwise regression on measured data to validate the first steps of the output of numerical prediction. These models are called MOS(Model Output Statistics)-models and so they make use of historical measured data for given weather conditions. Also there are some weather models that even use deep learning approaches. 
The biggest usage of ML and DP in meteorology today is in remote sensing, images of satellite and radar, predicting movement of clouds and precipitation areas and detecting severe weather events for nowcasting/ short term weather prediction (hours). Deep Learning will be used to get whole earth-coverage with radar images (cloud profiling radar, airborne radar, microbust radar, precipitation radar ...). The range of the different radars veries between 2 km and 800 km and so it is not possible to cover the whole earth. In that case meteorologist use Convolution Neural Networks (CNN).
